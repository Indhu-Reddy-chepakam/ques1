1.you are given two lists of different lengths of positive numbers write a algorithm to count the number of elements that are not common to each list.

n=list(map(int,input().split()))
a=list(map(int,input().split()))

e_len=len(e)
sum=d_len+e_len
print(sum)

2. you are playing a online game in the list of n numbers is given the player has to arrange the numbers so that all the odd numbers come after even numbers

for i in a:
    if i%2==0:
        li.append(i)

5.A university have following grade policy every student receives grade  in b/w 0 to 100 any grade less 40 is a failing grade a professor at the university wants to round of each grade according to this rules if the difference b/w grade and next multiple of 5 is less than 3 then grade will be round off to next multiple of 5 .if the grade value is less than 38 no rounding occurs as the result will be failing grade writing a algorithm to round of given grades .
